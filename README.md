# Digital Library Organizer

A mini PHP system that simulates a **Digital Library Organizer** — demonstrating recursion, hash tables, and binary search trees (BST) for managing and displaying book data.
---

# Project Overview

This project showcases three core data structure concepts implemented in PHP:

1. **Recursion** – Used to navigate and display nested book categories.
2. **Hash Tables (Associative Arrays)** – Used to store and retrieve book metadata such as author, year, and genre.
3. **Binary Search Tree (BST)** – Used to store and search book titles alphabetically.

This aligns with the learning objectives of algorithmic thinking, recursive structures, and associative data management.

##  Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:
- Apply recursion to solve hierarchical problems.
- Understand how associative arrays (hash tables) store and access data efficiently.
- Implement a binary search tree for efficient data retrieval.
- Strengthen problem-solving and logical thinking in PHP.

##  How to Run using XAMPP

Step-by-Step: How to Run the Project using XAMPP

1. Install XAMPP
If you don’t have it yet:
Download from: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html
Install and open the XAMPP Control Panel.

2. Start Your Local Server
In XAMPP Control Panel:
Click Start next to Apache (for PHP).
If you plan to use MySQL later, also click Start next to MySQL.
You should see green indicators beside them.

3. Place the Project in the XAMPP Directory
Go to your XAMPP installation folder.
Example path:
C:\xampp\htdocs
Inside htdocs, create a new folder (example: digital-library-organizer).
Copy all your PHP project files into that folder.
